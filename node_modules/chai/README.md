Chai is a BDD / TDD assertion library for [node](http://nodejs.org) and the browser that
can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework.

For more information view the [documentation](http://chaijs.com).

## Installation

Chai is available for both node.js server-side and the browser.

### Node.js

Package is available through [npm](http://npmjs.org):

    npm install chai

Recommend adding it to package.json devDependancies.

### Browser

Include the chai browser build in your testing suite.

    <script src="chai.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

Currently supports all modern browsers: IE 9+, Chrome 7+, FireFox 4+, Safari 5+

## Tests 

Chai tests itself in the browser using [mocha](https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha).
Have a look at the `test/browser` folder for an example.
