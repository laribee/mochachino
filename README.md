= Mochachino

The project creates some simple affordances for browser testing with the (Mocha javascript testing framework)[http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha] to aid in browser testing.

This is very much a work-in-progress (like not working yet work in progress), but some initial goals include:

- Automatically pull in test and source files using glob patterns, instead of having to edit an html file manually.
- Use web sockets to re-run tests in a browser automatically and report back to the command line runner (faster feedback).
- Open to suggestion??
